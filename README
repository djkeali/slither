Slither: Taking a Bite Out of Canvas (1.0)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A modern replica of the 2D, retro "Snake" or "Nibbles" game, wherein the player navigates
a snake around the screen eating objects that are scattered about the playing area. This
action in turn grows the length of the snake and increases the player's score. When all
food items have been eaten, the next level starts: each with a touch more of difficulty
(poison items, walls, and so on).
